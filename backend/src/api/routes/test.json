  "ai": "  Of course! Yes, I can help you build a base class for interacting with different databases. Here's an example of how you could do this:
            BaseClass.py:
                    class DatabaseBase:
                        def __init__(self):
                                # Initialize the database connection
                                self.db = None
                        def connect_to_database(self, db_type):
                            # Connect to the appropriate database based on the type
                            if db_type == "redis":
                                # Connect to Redis
                                self.redis_connection = redis.Redis(host="localhost", port=6379, db=0)
                            elif db_type == "mongodb":
                                # Connect to MongoDB
                                self.mongodb_connection = pymongo.MongoClient("mongodb://localhost:27017/")
                            else:
                                raise ValueError("Invalid database type")
                        def execute_sql_query(self, query):
                            # Execute a SQL query on the connected database
                            cursor = self.db.cursor()
                            cursor.execute(query)
                            results = cursor.fetchall()
                            return results

            ChildClass.py:

                    class SocialMediaBase:

                        # Inherit from the base class for database interaction
                        import DatabaseBase

                        db = DatabaseBase()

                        def get_social_media_data(self):
                            # Call the parent class's execute_sql_query method to retrieve data from the database
                            results = self.db.execute_sql_query("SELECT * FROM social_media")
                            return results

            End of ChildClass.py

            You can use this base class to interact with different kinds of databases, such as Redis and Mongo, in a consistent manner. The child class can inherit from the base class and override the necessary methods to perform database operations specific to that class."
